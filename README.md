# Vno - Hugo [WIP]
Vno Hugo is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), it's a port of [onevcat](https://github.com/onevcat)'s [Vno - Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll).

## How to Use
Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:
```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/xslingcn/vno-hugo.git themes/vno-hugo
```
Copy everything in the `exampleSite` folder to the root of your hugo site, then run `hugo serve`. Your site with `Vno Hugo` enabled should be accessible in http://localhost:1313/.
